# Some more about me
> I prefer to dream that burnished surfaces are a figuration and promise of the infinite.

--Jorge Luis Borges, *The Library of Babel*

That quote benefits from context. The story describes an infinite library of identical rooms with walls coated in books of (mostly) meaningless gibberish. I choose to believe that, like the library, most naturally-occuring things are inherently meaningless, but that vacuum of purpose leaves us free to imbue *any*thing with *any* meaning we choose. I try to choose wisely, in ways that bring me peace while doing my best to not deprive anyone else of that same opportunity.

###### In hindsight, that doesn't do much for context for the quote, but maybe that's just more reason to read the story. It's quite short. 

# Interests and Projects

In any case, that philosophy has led me to a few core interests and many, *many* more tangentially related ones. Some of the former are:
- Deepening my understanding of **technology** to better understand the people who build and interact with it
- Paying close attention to **language** (spoken, written, body, all of them) because it's the only way to be any more than just one person
- Studying **physical sciences** because the laws of the universe seem to form a language of their own
- Indulging **any exploration of new topics**, no matter how trivial or whimsical, as long as it doesn't endanger any of the preceding interests

Projects I'm currently working on include:
* A carrier board for SoM devices with a wide array of general-purpose peripherals
* A personal, from-scratch website to track my projects and share them with anyone who might be interested in replicating or building upon them
* A resin-printed fragrance sample holder stylized as a chunk of honeycomb
* A modern, intuitive thermostat for controlling and monitoring temperatures and humidities of reptile enclosures from a mobile app
* A printed circuit board coaster that detects when a drink is placed on it with an infrared proximity sensor and illuminates the outer perimeter in response
